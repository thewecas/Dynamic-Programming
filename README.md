## Questions 
1. Write a function `fib(n)` that takes in a number as an argument. The function should return the n-th number of fibonacci sequence. [Open Code](https://github.com/thewecas/Dynamic-Programming/blob/master/Fibonacci.java) 
2. Say that you are a traveller on a 2D grid, you begin in the top-left corner and your goal is to travel to the bottom-right corner.you may only move down or right. In how many ways can you travel to the goal on a grid with dimension m*n? [Open Code](https://github.com/thewecas/Dynamic-Programming/blob/master/GridTraveller.java)
3. Write a function `canSum(targetSum, numbers)` that takes a targetSum and an array of numbers as arguments. The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not it is possible to generate the targetSum using numbers from the array. You may use an element of the array as many times as needed. You may assume that all input numbers are non-negative. [Open Code](https://github.com/thewecas/Dynamic-Programming/blob/master/CanSum.java)
4. Write a function `howSum(targetSum, numbers)` that takes a targetSum and an array of numbers as arguments. The function should return an array containing any combination of elements that add up to exactly the targetSum. if there is no combination that adds up to targetSum, then return null. If there are multiple combination possible, you return  any single one. [Open Code](https://github.com/thewecas/Dynamic-Programming/blob/master/HowSum.java)
5. Write a function `bestSum(targetSum, numbers)` that takes in a targetSum and an array of numbers as arguments. The function should return an array containing the shortest combination of numbers that add up to exactly the targetSum.If there's a tie for the shortest combination, you may return any one of the shortest.
